# The Universal Rights and the Constitution of Planet Mars.

The legal principles of our brave civilization are created as a
logical abstraction from this declaration of basic rights on Planet Mars.
Future generations may change and create better versions of this constitution,
when they can collect the majority agreement of 75%, from all regional residents.
Different versions of this Mars constitution may exist in different geographic regions of our civilization.

All individuals can have legal rights and obligations as long as the state can recognize them
as living individuals with an intellect or basic intelligence that does require the state to
assign legal rights or the legal identity. Individuals are above the legal organizations in
the order of protection of their rights. Different animals, humans, aliens, robots, AI
and similar types of individuals can have different rights and obligations.
