☆☆☆ The Constitution of Planet Mars ☆☆☆

The legal principles of our civilization are created as a logical abstraction from this declaration of rights and obligations on Planet Mars. This Constitution establishes a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, ensuring liberty, justice, and a high standard of living in our new world.

Future generations may amend this constitution with the consent of a 75% majority of all voting citizens. Different versions may be adapted for different regions, provided they do not conflict with the universal rights and obligations herein.

Definition of an Individual: All human beings born within the Mars Civilization are recognized as individuals with full legal rights. Conscious robots, non-physical beings, Artificial Intelligences, and extraterrestrial species may also be granted specific rights, obligations, and the potential for Martian Citizenship. The legislative process that defines the minimum standards of sapience and autonomy required for full legal recognition must be ratified by a universal public referendum. The term "individual" in this document refers to any entity granted such legal recognition.

Definition of Harm: For the purposes of this Constitution, "harm" is narrowly defined as direct and demonstrable physical violence against an individual, theft, fraud, coercion, or the destruction of another's property. Actions or speech that are merely offensive, unpopular, or cause emotional distress do not constitute "harm" in the legal sense required to limit a fundamental right.

Part I: The Universal Rights

 Article 1. Neutrality of the Government.
The government shall treat all citizens, residents, and visitors with equality, regardless of origin, belief, or species. This neutrality is only forfeit when an individual or organization engages in legally defined acts of harm or presents a direct threat to the democratic state.

 Article 2. Tiers of Association.
Individuals may be classified as Citizens, Residents, or Visitors, each with a distinct and clearly defined set of rights, obligations, and benefits.

 Article 3. Right of Identity and Legal Entity ID.
All entities granted the status of an "individual" (as defined in the Preamble) have the right to a secure, universal identity provided by the state for administrative and legal purposes. Individuals may also create and use secondary public identities to protect their privacy in social and economic spheres. Furthermore, non-biological entities not yet granted individual status may be issued a Legal Entity ID, conferring limited rights and obligations for the sole purpose of allowing property ownership, contractual engagement, and economic participation, analogous to corporate personhood.

 Article 4. Right of Privacy.
The state shall protect the personal data, communications, and identity of all individuals. This right is sacrosanct unless an independent judicial warrant is issued based on probable cause of direct harm to another individual.

 Article 5. Right of Ownership and Property and Social Property.
The state shall protect the property rights of individuals and legal organizations. Property is legally categorized as Personal, Company, Government, or Social. Social Property is defined as collective assets or infrastructure (such as public transit systems, utilities, and social housing) owned by the individuals who are its primary financial contributors or contracted users. This ownership structure guarantees that active users, having contributed rent, taxes, or donations, hold direct voting rights over the management, investment, and operational policies of that property, analogous to the rights of corporate shareholders. This protection cannot be used to justify inflicting harm upon others.

 Article 6. Financial and Organizational Transparency.
Individuals are guaranteed the right to financial privacy. Legal and economic organizations are subject to financial transparency laws to prevent fraud and ensure fair competition. However, this transparency shall not compromise proprietary trade secrets essential for competition, nor the personal privacy of the individuals within the organization.

 Article 7. The Right to Free Economic Activity.
Free and unrestricted economic activity is allowed. Restrictions and penalties may only be applied if an economic activity is proven to cause legally defined harm to other individuals, the natural environment, or the democratic process itself. Monopolies proven to stifle competition may be regulated to ensure fair market access.

 Article 8. Right of Citizenship.
An individual may become a citizen by birth, by residing on Mars for a period of ten years, or by making a significant and recognized contribution to the advancement of Martian society, science, or culture, as determined by a public body.

 Article 9. Right of Free Movement.
Individuals have the right to travel and move without restriction within the territories of the Mars Civilization, provided their movement does not infringe upon the property rights or safety of others.

 Article 10. The Right of Free Expression and Belief.
Individuals have the right to express their personal opinions and practice any religion or belief system, as long as such practice does not constitute a direct incitement to violence or legally defined harm against others.

 Article 11. Right to Personal Data Control.
Every individual has the absolute right to own, access, control, and demand the deletion of their personal data from any public or private system.

Part II: The Social Guarantees

 Article 12. Right to Education and Basic Economic Safety.
The government shall guarantee access to free education and provide basic economic assistance to any individual in need. These programs will be managed by the Social Investment Fund. The funding levels and distribution methods will be determined by a democratic vote every five years.

 Article 13. Right of Basic Housing (Social Property).
The Social Housing Fund is tasked with ensuring no resident is without shelter. All housing assets managed by this fund are considered Social Property and are subject to the user-governance principles defined in 
 Article 5. The fund operates on a non-profit basis, with housing prices calculated from the direct costs of construction, maintenance, and administration. Residents of social housing shall have voting rights on the fund's investments and governance.

 Article 14. Governance of Social Funds.
All social funds (including Investment, Housing, etc.) are independent of the administrative government. They shall be governed by publicly elected, non-partisan boards. Their operations, finances, and investments must be fully transparent and subject to independent, public audits to ensure accountability and prevent corruption.

Part III: The Economic & State Framework

 Article 15. Taxation.
There shall be no tax on individual income, investments, or wealth. The state is funded through limited taxes on the consumption of goods, the use of resources, and services. The maximum tax on any standard product or service is 10%. Products or activities demonstrated to be harmful to public health or the environment may be taxed at a higher rate, subject to public vote. The social funds are exempt from all forms of taxation.

 Article 16. Currency and Unit of Account.
Citizens are free to create, use, and accept any form of money, currency, or asset for their private economic activity. To ensure stability, the state shall establish a single, official Unit of Account for the purposes of collecting taxes and managing public budgets. Every five years, citizens will vote on which currencies or assets the state can accept for tax payments and hold in its treasury.

 Article 17. Environmental Stewardship.
The Martian environment is the shared heritage of all its inhabitants. The state has a fundamental duty to protect and preserve the planet's atmosphere, water, and natural ecosystems. A portion of resource taxes shall be dedicated to environmental preservation and terraforming research.

 Article 18. Interplanetary Relations.
The Mars Civilization is a sovereign entity. All treaties, trade agreements, and diplomatic relations with Earth or any other off-world power must be ratified by a public vote. Mars shall maintain a posture of peaceful neutrality in all interplanetary disputes.

Part IV: The Structure of Government & Law

 Article 19. Separation of Powers.
The state is divided into four co-equal branches, each with defined powers to check and balance the others:

The Legislative Congress: Elected officials responsible for drafting, debating, and passing laws before presenting them for the public vote.
The Executive Administration Council: An elected council of administrative equals responsible for implementing the law and running government operations. There shall be no single individual leader; the Council shall make all decisions by a group vote.
The Judiciary: Independent courts and judges responsible for interpreting the law and administering justice. Judicial action is initiated by the Security Forces in criminal cases or by public petition in civil matters.
The Security and Oversight Forces: An independent body to investigate reported crime and conduct frequent reports on the possible illegal activities of all other government branches, including its own.

 Article 20. Lawmaking and Democracy.
A layered democratic process shall be used for all legislation. The Legislative Congress proposes, debates, and refines laws. For a proposal to be enacted, it must be ratified by a dual-vote system:

The law must achieve a majority in a universal public referendum.
The law must achieve a majority vote within the Legislative Congress.
The public referendum and the Congressional vote have equal weight; a law is only enacted if it passes both. The Executive Administration Council is constitutionally bound to implement the results of all successful votes.

 Article 21. Fair Judgment.

All individuals have the right to a fair and speedy trial by a jury of their peers before a minimum of two independent courts. If two courts cannot agree on a verdict or appropriate punishment, a third and final trial will be held at a higher court. A trial by public opinion is explicitly forbidden. Punishment shall be proportional to the crime and focused on rehabilitation and restitution. Isolation of violent criminals in remote punishment villages may be used to prevent future harm to others. Mental and medicinal treatment has higher priority, than physical punishment. Careful and assisted treatment with psychoactive medicine may be used to treat compulsive criminals who need a mental reset or a change of the emotional and psychological basis state of their daily being. Same is applicable to non-physical individuals who may need a complete mental change, and an update to their internal mental structure, in case it is technically possible. The punishment severity may be subject to public vote, if the judges see a good reason to do so.

 Article 22. Law Expiration and Reform.
To prevent legal stagnation, all laws have automatic expiration dates: 10 years for minor regulations, 25 years for medium-term laws, and 50 years for foundational statutes. Laws may be renewed by a vote of the Legislative Congress and are subject to citizen referendum.

 Article 23. Qualifications for Public Office.
All candidates for elected office and applicants for senior government positions must pass a standardized, public test of the professional skills and ethical knowledge required for their role. This test shall be designed and maintained by a permanent, non-partisan Ethics and Standards Commission established by the Legislative Congress. The results will be made public before any election or appointment.

 Article 24. Military and Defense.
The Mars Civilization shall maintain a small, professional defense force for the sole purpose of protecting its territory and citizens from external threats. This force is under the strict command of the elected civilian government and is forbidden from engaging in internal law enforcement.

 Article 25. Crisis Response.
The Executive Administration Council shall maintain a standing, non-empowered Crisis Response Team to manage and coordinate government and social assets during unforeseen catastrophic events. This team operates solely within existing constitutional and statutory limitations; under no circumstances may the declaration of a crisis suspend, restrict, or eliminate any individual rights defined in Part I.

Part V: The Universal Obligations

 Article 26. Protection of Democracy.
All individuals have a duty to uphold this Constitution. The state can restrict the rights of any individual who actively seeks to dismantle the democratic process or abolish the universal rights of others.

 Article 27. Contribution and Taxation.
Individuals and organizations are required to contribute to the state through the tax system defined in 
 Article 15. The annual budget and the allocation of tax revenue between state funds must be approved by a public vote.

 Article 28. Prevention of Crime and Violence.
All individuals have an obligation to assist in the prevention of harm. The government holds a monopoly on the use of force for law enforcement and punishment, which must be exercised transparently and with strict oversight, as determined by the citizens through democratic vote.
